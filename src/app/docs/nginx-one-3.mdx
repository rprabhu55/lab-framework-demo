## NGINX One Console introduction

Before we go into NGINX One Console, lets take a step back and understand **NGINX One**.

### What is NGINX One?

NGINX One is an all-in-one platform that integrates the best of NGINX’s offerings into a unified package that includes a
cloud-based dashboard and access to F5 Distributed Cloud. Customers get advanced load balancing, web and application
server capabilities, API gateway functionalities, and security features. The goal of NGINX One is to provide
unparalleled performance, security, and scalability for modern applications, whether they are deployed in the cloud,
on-premises, or in hybrid environments.

NGINX One can be view as a whole package that includes all NGINX products such as NGINX Open Source, NGINX Plus, NGINX
Ingress Controller, etc. One product that falls under the **NGINX One** is **NGINX One Console**, which we are covering
in this session.

### NGINX One Console

Although the name **NGINX One** sounds very similar to **NGINX One Console**, it is actually a
Software as a Service (SaaS) product. So try not to use **NGINX One** and **NGINX One Console** interchangeably because
they are different. The NGINX One Console gives all NGINX users access to a SaaS experience for managing NGINX instances
as part of the F5 Distributed Cloud. It gives NGINX users unrivaled visibility, delivery and optimization capabilities
combined with the speed and flexibility of the F5 Distributed Cloud Platform.

The NGINX One Console is valuable because it simplifies the complexities of modern application delivery by integrating
multiple functionalities into a single platform. This reduces the need for disparate tools, lowers operational overhead
and costs, and ensures robust security for your applications. Additionally, its comprehensive feature set—including
advanced load balancing, enhanced security, and performance optimization—provides customers with a reliable, scalable,
and secure solution for managing their applications.

You will be able to accelerate application delivery and time-to-value like never before with flexible pricing and SaaS
capabilities.

With NGINX One Console, you will get improved:

- Performance at scale
- Visibility and insight
- Security and control

### System outline

Let's now go through a system diagram of how other NGINX products interacts with NGINX One Console.

![](media/upskill/presentation-1.png)

The diagram shows all NGINX products in a customer's environment but this session focuses on NGINX Open Source and NGINX
Plus being managed by NGINX One Console.

NGINX One Console is a service provided within F5 Distributed Cloud.

The NGINX Instances are located in the customers environment.

### How does NGINX Instances Connect to NGINX One?

The NGINX instances communicates with the NGINX One Console using an agent which is installed on the NGINX instance
during the onboarding process. The following table shows commination details to NGINX One Console. Any outgoing
firewall rules must allow the following type of traffic from the instances.

| Type     | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Port     | 443   |
| Protocol | gRPC  |

There are also a total of 2 gRPC connections for the following type of traffic.

1. Control Plane
1. Metrics Steam

## Upskill session layout

In these sessions, we are breaking the labs into into the following sections below.

- Demo: We will demonstrate the use case.
- Interactive: You are expected configure and validate a use case.
- Fix It: We will provide a broken configuration and you are expected to fix the issue.

### Environment

The diagram of the lab environment is shown in the diagram below.

![](media/upskill/presentation-3.png)

A total of 3 systems will be available.
1. Lab Framework
1. NGINX Plus Instance
1. NGINX Open Source Instance

The **Lab Framework** contains the following
- **docker** installed
- this Lab Guide

Portions of this session will involve bring up NGINX instance containers that run on the Lab Framework system.

### Demo
We start each use case session with the **Demo Lab** where the instructor will be the one sharing
and driving the configuration of a use case. Participants, if they want, can follow along and run
through the same set of demo labs using their running UDF lab environments.

### Interactive
Next, participants join break out groups and be expected to complete the Interactive Lab.
Participants may need to update configuration files in order to get a working solution.

### Fix it
The last exercise of the upskilling session asks the participants to deploy a broken solution and
then using their validation and troubleshooting knowledge solve the mystery.

## Use Cases

We will now be covering the following use cases below.

1. NGINX Instance Management
1. NGINX Instance
1. Exploring NGINX One Console Dashboard

Now that you have a basic understanding of the NGINX One Console, lets move on to the next step where we will have some
hand on experience.

Lets now make sure you can access to an XC tenant. When you brought up this UDF Blueprint, it also provisions access to
XC.

## What is NGINX One?

NGINX One is an all-in-one platform that integrates the best of NGINX’s offerings into a unified package that includes a cloud-based dashboard and access to [F5 Distributed Cloud](https://www.f5.com/cloud). Customers get advanced load balancing, web and application server capabilities, API gateway functionalities, and security features. The goal of NGINX One is to provide unparalleled performance, security, and scalability for modern applications, whether they are deployed in the cloud, on-premises, or in hybrid environments.

## NGINX One Console

NGINX One Console gives all NGINX users access to a SaaS experience for managing NGINX instances as part of the F5 Distributed Cloud. It gives NGINX users unrivaled visibility, delivery and optimization capabilities combined with the speed and flexibility of the F5 Distributed Cloud Platform.

The NGINX One Console is valuable because it simplifies the complexities of modern application delivery by integrating multiple functionalities into a single platform. This reduces the need for disparate tools, lowers operational overhead and costs, and ensures robust security for your applications. Additionally, its comprehensive feature set—including advanced load balancing, enhanced security, and performance optimization—provides customers with a reliable, scalable, and secure solution for managing their applications.

You will be able to accelerate application delivery and time-to-value like never before with flexible pricing and SaaS capabilities.

With NGINX One Console, you will get improved:

- Performance at scale
- Visibility and insight
- Security and control

## Lab Introduction

This lab will give you an overview of how the NGINX One console provides visibility into a global fleet of NGINX instances, both NGINX Plus and NGINX Open Source (OSS).

After this lab, you will be able to:

- Access and navigate the NGINX One console
- Manage NGINX configuration
- Review recommendations from the NGINX One console
- Setup Config Sync Groups
- Install the NGINX Agent on both NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS instances (optional)

## Prerequisites

The "NGINX One Enablement Lab" UDF blueprint contains all the prerequisites for this lab. This includes:

- This interactive lab guide
- NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS instances

    ![image](media/lab0-07.png)

1. Several **Guidance ToolTips** might appear. These are used to inform users of new features when the F5 XC console is updated. Close the dialogues and continue.

## Accessing NGINX One Console

Once logged into the F5 XC console, the "home" screen shows you various tiles which represent console features. For example, you might configure Multicloud networking from the "Multi-Cloud Network Connect" tile, build global server load balancing rules from the "DNS Management" tile, or view synthetic monitoring data from the "Observability" tile. In this lab, we'll focus on the NGINX One console.

> :point_right: **Note:** Your permissions in the F5 XC console are specific to this lab. You don't have permissions to all the tiles on the "home" screen.

1. Click the **NGINX One** tile from the home screen.

    ![NGINX One in the XC Console](media/lab1-1.png)

1. The NGINX One "welcome" screen will appear. Click **Visit Service** to proceed to the NGINX One console.

    ![The NGINX One Welcome Screen](media/lab1-2.png)

1. The NGINX One Dashboard shows an overview of your environment, including availability, platform and version distribution, and CVEs/configuration recommendations. Your dashboard will vary depending on what is installed in your tenant. Feel free to click around and explore.

    ![NGINX One Dashboard](media/lab1-3.png)

1. In the left-hand menu in the *Manage* section is the *Instances* link. You may or may not have any existing instances in your tenant. Don’t worry if there aren’t any, you will be deploying two instances later in the lab. If there are any existing instances, click an instance’s hostname to view its details.

## Connecting to the Console

NGINX One uses an agent installed alongside NGINX to communicate with the NGINX One service.

![There are two instances in the customer environment: one Plus and one OSS. An additional NGINX Agent is installed alongside NGINX in each instance, and the Agent communicates between the NGINX instance and the NGINX One service.](media/lab2-1.png)

The agent uses a Data Plane Key to authenticate and identify itself to NGINX One. In this lab we will create a new Data Plane Key, and use it to install the NGINX Agent on the NGINX Plus instance.

### Generating a Data Plane Key

As you continue through this lab, you will be using a randomly-generated name that you will use to create items in the NGINX One console.<br/>Your assigned name is: **<GetVariable name="petname" />**.<br />
You will notice it appear throughout the lab guide content. The use of this name is *crucial* when creating objects in the NGINX One Console in order to differentiate your items from those of other students also working in this shared environment.

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left hand menu under the "Manage" section, select **Data Plane Keys**.

1. Click **Add Data Plane Key**.

1. Give the key a name based on your lab's ephemeral name, such as **<GetVariable name="petname" />-nginx-key**.

    > :point_right: **Note:** You are working in a shared environment; keep track of your resources, and be careful not to accidentally modify anyone else's.

1. By default, the key expiration date will be set to 1 year.  Depending on your use case, you may want to set a shorter expiration date.  For this lab, we will use the default value.

1. Click **Generate**.

    ![Generating a Data Plane Key](media/lab2-4.png)

1. The Data Plane Key will be displayed. Click the *Copy* icon to copy the key to the clipboard.

    > :warning: **Warning:** *SAVE THIS KEY SOMEWHERE SAFE.* There is no way to retrieve the key after you click **close**. This key will be used in multiple labs.

    ![Data Plane Key](media/lab2-5.png)

1. Now enter the Data Plane Key in the *Set Variable* component below and click the **Save** button; this will allow the lab guide to use the key in further steps.

    <InputVariable 
        name="NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN"
    />

### Deploy NGINX Container

Now that we have a data plane key, we can attach our first NGINX instance to the NGINX One Console.

> **Note:** This lab will focus more on the NGINX One Console and less on how to install NGINX Agent on your NGINX instance and connect the instance to NGINX One.  If this is something you would like to explore in greater depth, check out the optional labs at the end of this lab guide.

1. To start your NGINX instance, click the **Run** button for each NGINX instances to deploy them and have them automatically connect to the NGINX One Console:

    <DockerContainer>
        <Docker  
            name="nginx-plus-1"
            desc="NGINX Plus R32 with Agent."
            image="private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/agent:debian"
            env={[
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_GRPCPORT", value: "443"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_HOST", value: "agent.connect.nginx.com"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_ENABLE", value: "true"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY", value: "false"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN", isVariable: true, isSecret: true},
            ]}
            attrs={[
                { name: "volume", value: `${process.env["CONTAINER_MOUNT_BASE_DIR"]}/ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl` }
            ]}
        />
    </DockerContainer>

    <SetVariable
        name="nginx-plus-1"
        isComponent="true"
    />
    <SetVariable
        name="nginx-plus-2"
        isComponent="true"
    />
    <SetVariable
        name="nginx-plus-3"
        isComponent="true"
    />
    <SetVariable
        name="nginx-oss-1"
        isComponent="true"
    />
    <SetVariable
        name="nginx-oss-2"
        isComponent="true"
    />
    <SetVariable
        name="NGINX_AGENT_INSTANCE_GROUP_OSS"
        value={`${process.env["PETNAME"]}-oss`}
    />

    > Note: If you receive an error, it may be that you have not input and saved the **NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN** variable above.

1. Once the NGINX instance is up and running, press the **Test** button, to confirm the instance is online and responding to HTTP requests.

Now, lets get started on the lab!

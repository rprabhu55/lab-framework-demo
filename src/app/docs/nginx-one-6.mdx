## Use Case 2: Config Sync Groups

Config Sync Groups allow us to group multiple NGINX instances and leverage an identical configuration across all instances. This feature is extremely helpful in ephemeral environments, such as Docker and Kubernetes, as the NGINX instance can pull its configuration versus needing to rebuild the NGINX container every time the configuration changes. This section will go through using this feature.

The high level diagram showing this interaction can be seen below.

### Creating a Config Sync Group

1. Go to the NGINX One Console.

1. From the left menu in the *Manage* section, click on *Config Sync Groups*.

1. Click on *Add Config Sync Group*.

    ![Add Config Sync Group](media/lab5-1.png)

1. On the right, enter your unique lab deployment name, **<GetVariable name="petname" />**, then select *Create* on the bottom.

    ![Create New Config Sync Group](media/lab5-2.png)

1. Your unique Config Sync Group **<GetVariable name="petname" />** should be in the list.

    ![New Config Sync Group](media/lab5-3.png)

You can now explore your Config Sync Group by selecting **<GetVariable name="petname" />**.
When you select it, there are two tabs named *Details* and *Configuration*.

On the *Details* tab, there are two views: *Details* represents additional details of this group and *Instances* represents the NGINX instances that are in this group.

On the *Configuration* tab, there is a view that defines the NGINX configurations to use for all NGINX instances in this Config Sync Group.

#### Adding new NGINX instances to config sync group

We will now proceed with populating our Config Sync Group with two NGINX Plus instances: an NGINX Plus Virtual Machine provided by the lab blueprint, and an NGINX Plus Docker Container which we will create on our own. We will use the default configuration provided by the NGINX Plus virtual machine as the Config Sync Group's configuration.

We have two methods of adding instances to our sync group:
1. If the instance is NOT already registered with NGINX One, we will need to run a series of setup commands to register and add the instance to the config sync group.
1. If the instance is already registered with NGINX One and has a running NGINX Agent, manually updating the agent's config with the sync group parameter will add the instance to the sync group.

As we are using a fresh environment for this lab, **we will only use the first method** which will automatically register and add our NGINX Plus instances to the config sync group.
1. SSH into your **NGINX Plus** component and use the following command to install and run the NGINX Agent. Make sure to use your Data Plane Key and config sync group name where indicated.

    ```bash
    curl https://agent.connect.nginx.com/nginx-agent/install | DATA_PLANE_KEY="[YOUR DATA PLANE KEY]" sh -s -- -y -c [YOUR CONFIG SYNC GROUP]
    ```
    Once the installation has completed, the NGINX Instance will appear as an instance managed by your config sync group. If it doesn't immediately appear in the list, try clicking the refresh button.

1. Now SSH into the **Lab Framework** component and run the following command to deploy a new NGINX Plus Container. Make sure you use your data plane key and the name of your config sync group where indicated:
   >**Note:** When adding an NGINX Plus docker container, the instructions provided by the NGINX One console tell you how to:
   > 1. Login to the NGINX private registry
   > 2. Pull an NGINX Plus instance from the NGINX private registry
   > 3. Run the container with the required NGINX One Console connection details
   > For the purpose of this lab, we have already completed the first two steps for you, so you will only need to deploy the NGINX Image.
    ```bash
    sudo docker run \
    --env=NMS_SERVER_GRPCPORT=443 \
    --env=NMS_SERVER_HOST=agent.connect.nginx.com \
    --env=NMS_SERVER_TOKEN="[YOUR DATA PLANE KEY]" \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_INSTANCE_GROUP=[YOUR CONFIG SYNC GROUP] \
    --env=NMS_TLS_ENABLE=true \
    --restart=always \
    --runtime=runc \
    -d private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/agent:debian
    ```
    
    Confirm that the NGINX Container is running using the following command:
    ```bash
    docker ps | grep nginx-plus
    ```

    ![](media/lab6-1.png)

    Once the installation has completed, the NGINX Plus container will appear as an instance managed by your config sync group. If it doesn't immediately appear in the list, try clicking the refresh button.

Your config sync group should now be populated by two NGINX Plus instances, one VM and one running Docker container.

#### (Additional Info) Adding an already registered instance to the config sync group

Though not applicable for the purposes of this lab, this method assumes that a target NGINX instance is already registered in the NGINX One console, and therefore has a running NGINX agent associated with the console. In order to add a registered instance to a config sync group, we need to manually update the agent's configuration with our config sync group's information.

1. On the target NGINX instance, navigate to the agent's config file in the **/var/lib/nginx-agent/** directory, then open the **agent-dynamic.conf** file in a text editor.

1. The following code is added to the bottom of the **agent-dynamic.conf** file.

    ```nginx
    instance_group: [YOUR CONFIG SYNC GROUP NAME GOES HERE]
    ```
    The agent-dynamic.conf file should look similar to the example below:
    ```nginx
    # agent-dynamic.conf
    #
    # Dynamic configuration file for NGINX Agent.
    #
    # The purpose of this file is to track NGINX Agent configuration
    # values that can be dynamically changed via the API and the NGINX Agent install script.
    # You may edit this file, but API calls that modify the tags on this system will
    # overwrite the tag values in this file.
    #
    # The NGINX Agent configuration values that API calls can modify are as follows:
    #    - tags
    #
    # The NGINX Agent configuration value(s) that the NGINX Agent install script can modify are as follows:
    #    - instance_group
    instance_group: [YOUR CONFIG SYNC GROUP NAME GOES HERE]
    ```

1. The NGINX Agent is restarted using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nginx-agent
    ```

This NGINX Instance will then appear as an instance managed by a config sync group after a few minutes.

> :warning: **Warning:** It is not advisable to use this method for registered NGINX Plus containers due to their inherently ephemeral nature. If you wish to add a containerized NGINX Plus instance to your config sync group, it is highly recommended to create a new NGINX Plus container within the config sync group using the method described earlier.

#### Viewing Logs

Let's take a look under the hood at how a config sync group pushes configuration updates to all of its constituent NGINX instances simultaneously.
To do so, we'll examine the logs of the NGINX Agent (and others) in real-time for several instances simultaneously.

1. Open an SSH window for your **NGINX Plus** instance and use the following command to view its NGINX Agent log in real time.
    ```bash
    sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx-agent/agent.log
    ```

1. Open an SSH window for the **Lab Framework** VM and locate the running NGINX Plus Docker container using the following command:
    ```bash
    docker ps | grep nginx-plus
    ```
    Take note of the container ID, then access the NGINX Plus container using the following command:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it [NGINX PLUS CONTAINER ID] bash
    ```
    This will open up a bash shell session within the container. Once inside, use the following command to access the NGINX Agent log within the container.
    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/nginx-agent/agent.log
    ```
1. Place both SSH windows side-by-side so you can observe them both simultaneously.
    ![](media/lab6-3.png)
1. Navigate to your sync group's configuration tab. Here, you can make any valid edits to the Config Sync Group configuration that you wish. In this case, we will add the following simple comment at the top of the **/etc/nginx/conf.d/demo.conf** file:

    ```nginx
    ## This is a config change made through the Config Sync Group.
    ```
    The updated configuration should look similar to the example below. Note the location of the comment we made at the top:
    ```nginx
    ## This is a config change made through the Config Sync Group.
    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        server_name app_server;

        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/app-server-error.log notice;
        index demo-index.html index.html;
        expires -1;

        sub_filter_once off;
        sub_filter 'server_hostname' '$hostname';
        sub_filter 'server_address'  '$server_addr:$server_port';
        sub_filter 'server_url'      '$request_uri';
        sub_filter 'remote_addr'     '$remote_addr:$remote_port';
        sub_filter 'server_date'     '$time_local';
        sub_filter 'client_browser'  '$http_user_agent';
        sub_filter 'request_id'      '$request_id';
        sub_filter 'nginx_version'   '$nginx_version';
        sub_filter 'document_root'   '$document_root';
        sub_filter 'proxied_for_ip'  '$http_x_forwarded_for';
    }
    ```

1. Make sure the edits you made are valid, then save and publish these changes.

1. Now observe the agent.log feed on both instances as the configuration update is applied. For both instances you will see a series of log messages appear, indicating that the configuration change is being sent and applied to each instance.
    ![](media/lab6-4.png)
    You will notice several matching log records for both instances as the update is being applied. Note the highlighted lines in the log and observe the timestamps for both, they are identical. When a configuration update is made to a Config Sync Group, it is applied to every instance in the group simultaneously via the NGINX Agent.
---
#### Modifying a managed instance

What happens if we try to make configuration changes to a particular NGINX instance inside a Config Sync Group?

1. Open an SSH Window for your **NGINX Plus** instance, then navigate to the **/etc/nginx/conf.d/** directory, then open the **demo.conf** file in a text editor of your choice.

1. Now you can make any edits to the configuration that you wish, including adding, rewording, or even deleting entire sections of the configuration. For our purposes, let's add the following **server block** to the **/etc/nginx/conf.d/demo.conf** file:
    ```nginx
        location /test_publish {
            default_type text/html;
            return 200 '<html><body><h1>Config change made outside an NGINX One Config Sync Group</h1></body></html>';
        }
    ```
    Our demo.conf file should look similar to the example below. Note the location of the server block we added at the bottom:
    
    ```nginx
    ## This is a change made to an instance managed by a Config Sync Group.
    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        server_name app_server;

        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/app-server-error.log notice;
        index demo-index.html index.html;
        expires -1;

        sub_filter_once off;
        sub_filter 'server_hostname' '$hostname';
        sub_filter 'server_address'  '$server_addr:$server_port';
        sub_filter 'server_url'      '$request_uri';
        sub_filter 'remote_addr'     '$remote_addr:$remote_port';
        sub_filter 'server_date'     '$time_local';
        sub_filter 'client_browser'  '$http_user_agent';
        sub_filter 'request_id'      '$request_id';
        sub_filter 'nginx_version'   '$nginx_version';
        sub_filter 'document_root'   '$document_root';
        sub_filter 'proxied_for_ip'  '$http_x_forwarded_for';

        location /test_publish {
            default_type text/html;
            return 200 '<html><body><h1>Config change made outside an NGINX One Config Sync Group</h1></body></html>';
        }
    }
    ```
    Now save and exit the file.
1. Go back to the **details** tab of your config sync group and take note of the **Config Sync Status**. You should see a yellow indicator with the text "**Sync In Progress**". After a few seconds, this indicator should turn green with the text **"In Sync"**.
1. Now return to the SSH window for your NGINX Plus instance and re-open the **demo.conf** file. The location block we added earlier should have been removed entirely.
    ![](media/lab6-5.png)
1. Now view the **/var/log/nginx-agent/agent.log**. You will notice log records indicating that the NGINX Agent had retrieved and applied the Config Sync Group configuration once again.
    ![](media/lab6-6.png)
Feel free to repeat this process and make as many edits as you want to the demo.conf file. As soon as you save your changes, NGINX One will automatically override them and re-apply the Config Sync Group's configuration to the instance.
> :point_right: If a permanent configuration change needs to be made to a specific instance within a config sync group, the instance should be removed from a config sync group so that it can be managed individually.

### Review

Great job! Through the use of Config Sync Groups, you have now accomplished a common Day-2 operation of scaling or upgrading your NGINX instances and NGINX One Console made this process extremely easy and fast!  You can also do this via the [NGINX One Console API](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-one/api/api-reference-guide/) if you prefer to handle these steps through a pipeline.

    > :point_right: It is possible to mix NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS instances in a Config Sync Group. However, the NGINX configuration must be compatible for both the NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS instances. For example, you will not be able to publish configurations that are exclusive to NGINX Plus, like [JWT authentication](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-jwt-authentication/) to NGINX OSS. However, the ability to mix NGINX editions in a Config Sync Group can be very valuable in certain situations, such as when migrating from NGINX OSS to NGINX Plus.

## Lab Cleanup

Time to clean up the resources you created in this lab. As a safety precaution, the NGINX One console will not allow you to delete an instance that is online. We will first have to shut down the instances before deleting them from the NGINX One console.

1. On the **Lab Framework** machine, stop any running NGINX Plus Docker instances. First identify the container ID's using the following command:
    ```bash
    docker ps | grep nginx-plus
    ```
    This will list all running NGINX Plus Docker instances. Take note of the container IDs, then run the following command to stop and remove each container:
    ```bash
    docker stop [NGINX Container ID] && docker rm [NGINX Container ID]
    ```

1. Go to your **NGINX Plus** instance and uninstall the NGINX Agent using the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop nginx-agent && sudo apt-get remove nginx-agent -y
    ```

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left-hand menu in the *Manage* section, select *Instances*.

1. Wait until your **<GetVariable name="petname" />*** instances transition into the **Unavailable** state before proceeding. You may need to click the *Refresh* button at the top right of the instance list.

    ![Instance Unavailable](media/cleanup-3.png)

1. For each of your **<GetVariable name="petname" />*** instances, select the *Actions* "..." context menu, and select
    *Delete*.

    > :warning: **Warning:** Make sure you are deleting your own instances and not someone else’s.

    ![Deleting an instance](media/cleanup-4.png)

1. Confirm the deletion.

    ![Confirming the deletion](media/cleanup-5.png)

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left-hand menu in the *Manage* section, select *Config Sync Groups*.

1. Delete your **<GetVariable name="petname" />*** Config Sync Groups by selecting the *Actions* "..." context menu, then select *Delete* for each.

    ![Delete Config Sync Group](media/cleanup-8.png)

1. Confirm the deletion.

    ![Confirming the deletion](media/cleanup-9.png)

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left-hand menu in the *Manage* section, select *Data Plane Keys*.

1. Select the context menu for the Data Plane Key you created in lab 1, and select *Revoke*.

    > :warning: **Warning:** Make sure you are revoking your own key and not someone else’s.

    ![Revoking a Data Plane Key](media/cleanup-6.png)

1. Confirm the revocation.

    ![Confirming the revocation](media/cleanup-7.png)

Thank you for your time and attention to experience NGINX One Console!

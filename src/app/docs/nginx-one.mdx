description: An interactive lab highlighting the NGINX One Console
order: 2
---

NGINX made big news at the F5 annual user conference, [AppWorld](https://www.f5.com/appworld), by introducing [NGINX One](https://www.nginx.com/introducing-nginx-one/). NGINX One will give all F5 and NGINX customers access to a SaaS console for managing NGINX instances as part of the [F5 Distributed Cloud](https://www.f5.com/cloud). **NGINX One is released for testing in Early Access, and will be GA (Generally Available) in September.**

Once live, NGINX One will give NGINX users unrivaled visibility, delivery and optimization capabilities combined with the speed and flexibility of the F5 Distributed Cloud Platform.

You will be able to accelerate application delivery and time-to-value like never before with flexible pricing and SaaS capabilities.

With NGINX One, you will get improved:

- Performance at scale
- Visibility and insight
- Security and control

## Introduction

This lab will give you an overview of how NGINX One Console provides visibility into a global fleet of NGINX instances, both NGINX Plus and NGINX Open Source (OSS).

After this lab, you will be able to:

- Access and navigate the NGINX One console,
- Manage NGINX configuration
- Review recommendations from the NGINX One console
- Setup Config Sync Groups
- Install the NGINX Agent on both NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS instances (optional)

## Prerequisites

### UDF Blueprint

The "NGINX One Enablement Lab" blueprint contains the NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS instances that you will use during this lab. You should be comfortable accessing resources in UDF using SSH.

## Accessing Console

1. Log into your F5 Distributed Cloud Sales tenant.

1. Select the "NGINX One" product from the home screen.

    ![NGINX One in the XC Console](media/lab1-1.png)

1. The NGINX One welcome screen will appear. Click "Visit Service" to proceed to the NGINX One console.

    ![The NGINX One Welcome Screen](media/lab1-2.png)

1. The NGINX One Dashboard shows an overview of your environment, including availability, platform and version distribution, and CVEs/configuration recommendations. Your dashboard will vary depending on what is installed in your tenant. Feel free to click around and explore.

    ![NGINX One Dashboard](media/lab1-3.png)

1. In the left-hand menu in the "Manage" section is the "Instances" link. You may or may not have any existing instances in your tenant. Don’t worry if there aren’t any, you will be deploying two instances later in the lab. If there are any existing instances, click an instance’s hostname to view its details.

    ![NGINX One instance details](media/lab1-4.png)

## Connecting to the Console

NGINX One uses an agent installed alongside NGINX to communicate with the NGINX One service.

![There are two instances in the customer environment: one Plus and one OSS. An additional NGINX Agent is installed alongside NGINX in each instance, and the Agent communicates between the NGINX instance and the NGINX One service.](media/lab2-1.png)

The agent uses a Data Plane Key to authenticate and identify itself to NGINX One. In this lab we will create a new Data Plane Key, and use it to install the NGINX Agent on the NGINX Plus instance.

### Generating a Data Plane Key

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left hand menu under the "Manage" section, select "Data Plane Keys".

1. Click "Add Data Plane Key".

1. Give the key a name based on your lab's ephemeral name, such as *<GetVariable name="petname" />-nginx-key*. 

    > :point_right: **Note:** You are working in a shared tenant; keep track of your resources, and be careful not to accidentally modify anyone else's.

1. By default, the key expiration date will be set to 1 year.  Depending on your use case, you may want to set a shorter expiration date.  For this lab, we will use the default value.

1. Click "Generate"

    ![Generating a Data Plane Key](media/lab2-4.png)

1. The Data Plane Key will be displayed. Click the "Copy" icon to copy the key to the clipboard.

    > :warning: **Warning:** *SAVE THIS KEY SOMEWHERE SAFE.* There is no way to retrieve the key after you click close. This key will be used in multiple labs.

    ![Data Plane Key](media/lab2-5.png)

1. Now enter the Data Plane Key in the *Set Variable* component below and click the *Save* button; this will allow the lab guide to use the key in further steps.

    <InputVariable 
        name="NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN"
    />

### Deploy NGINX Containers

Now that we have a data plane key, we can attach NGINX instances to the NGINX One Console.

We have provided a few NGINX instances below for you to use for the remainder of this lab.  This lab will focus more on the NGINX One Console and less on how to install NGINX Agent on your NGINX instance and connect the instance to NGINX One.  If this is something you would like to explore in greater depth, check out the optional labs at the end of this lab guide.

1. To start your NGINX instances for this lab, click the *Run* button for each NGINX instances to deploy them and have them automatically connect to the NGINX One Console:

    <DockerContainer>
        <Docker 
            name="nginx-plus-1"

                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_ENABLE", value: "true"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY", value: "false"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN", isVariable: true, isSecret: true},
            ]}
            attrs={[
                { name: "volume", value: "/tmp/ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl" }
            ]}
        />

        <Docker 
            name="nginx-oss-agent"
            desc="NGINX OSS 1.27.1 with NGINX Agent."
            image="private-registry-test.nginx.com/nginx/agent:1.27.1-alpine"
            env={[
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_GRPCPORT", value: "443"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_HOST", value: "agent.connect.nginx.com"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_ENABLE", value: "true"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY", value: "false"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN", isVariable: true, isSecret: true},
            ]}
            attrs={[
                { name: "volume", value: "/tmp/ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl" }
            ]}
        />
    </DockerContainer>

1. Once the NGINX instances are up and running, press the *Test* button, to confirm the instances are online and responding to HTTP requests.

1. Return to the NGINX One Console. From the left menu in the *Manage* section, click *Instances*.

1. You should see your *<GetVariable name="nginx-plus-1" />* instance in the list. Click a hostname to view the instance details.

    ![NGINX One Instance List](media/lab2-7.png)

1. Explore the instance details:

    ![NGINX Plus instance details](media/lab2-8.png)

## Configuration via the Console

In this lab, we will leverage NGINX One Console to enable stub_status in our <GetVariable name="nginx-plus-1" /> NGINX instance's configuration.

### Adding a stub_status directive

1. In the NGINX One console Select *Manage* and then *Instances* from the left menu.

1. You should see your *<GetVariable name="nginx-plus-1" />* instance in the list. Click its hostname to view the instance details.

1. Click the "Configuration" link near the top of the instance screen. You will be presented with the configuration editor.

    ![Configuration link](media/lab3-1.png)

1. Click the "Edit Configuration" button above the editor.

    ![Edit Configuration link](media/lab3-2.png)

1. Select the **/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf** file from the tree view on the left side of the configuration editor.

    ![Select demo.conf file](media/lab3-3.png)

1. Edit the selected file to include a location block at the end of the server block with
    the "stub_status" directive. Add the following location block to the server block:

    ```nginx
    location = /nginx_status {
        stub_status;
    }
    ```

    The file should like this:

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen       80 default_server;
        server_name  localhost;

        #access_log  /var/log/nginx/host.access.log  main;

        location / {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }

        #error_page  404              /404.html;

        # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
        #
        error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        }

        # proxy the PHP scripts to Apache listening on 127.0.0.1:80
        #
        #location ~ \.php$ {
        #    proxy_pass   http://127.0.0.1;
        #}

        # pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000
        #
        #location ~ \.php$ {
        #    root           html;
        #    fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
        #    fastcgi_index  index.php;
        #    fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /scripts$fastcgi_script_name;
        #    include        fastcgi_params;
        #}

        # deny access to .htaccess files, if Apache's document root
        # concurs with nginx's one
        #
        #location ~ /\.ht {
        #    deny  all;
        #}

        # enable /api/ location with appropriate access control in order
        # to make use of NGINX Plus API
        #
        #location /api/ {
        #    api write=on;
        #    allow 127.0.0.1;
        #    deny all;
        #}

        # enable NGINX Plus Dashboard; requires /api/ location to be
        # enabled and appropriate access control for remote access
        #
        #location = /dashboard.html {
        #    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        #}
    
        location = /nginx_status {
            stub_status;
            access_log off;
        }    
    }

    ```

1. You will see that there is a message below the editor: 

    > *1 recommendation found for /etc/nginx/conf.d/demo.conf <br />
        Security - Error: stub_status should have access control list defined*. 

    - Why? NGINX One includes a configuration advisor and it identified that exposing the **stub_status** endpoint open to the world is considered a security risk. 
    - We can remediate this by adding an ACL to the **/nginx_status** location block to only allow our lab's local networks and NGINX Agent (running locally on the instance) to access the stub status endpoint.

    ![config warning](media/lab3-4.png)

1. Update the configuration to the following:

    ```nginx
    location /nginx_status {
        stub_status;
        allow 10.0.0.0/8;
        allow 172.18.0.0/16;
        allow 127.0.0.1;
        deny all;
    }
    ```

    Note that the warning should disappear.

1. Click *Next* to display the diff viewer. This view will show you the changes made to the configuration.

    ![Diff viewer](media/lab3-5.png)

1. Click *Save and Publish*. You will see a status message indicating changes are being published, followed by a success message after several seconds.

    ![Publish config pending](media/lab3-6.png)

    ![Publish config success](media/lab3-7.png)

1. Check that the stub_status module is working by clicking the *Check* button below.

    <APICheck 
        componentName="nginx-plus-1" 
        path="/nginx_status" 
        targetStatusCode={200}  
    />

### Using a TLS certificate

In this section, we will configure our *<GetVariable name="nginx-plus-1" />* NGINX instance to leverage an SSL/TLS certificate. 

1. In the NGINX One Console, edit the "/etc/nginx/conf.d/demo.conf" file again for the *<GetVariable name="nginx-plus-1" />* instance to add the following to the server block:

    ```nginx
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/wildcard.f5demos.com.crt.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/wildcard.f5demos.com.key.pem;
    ```

    The entire file should now look as follows:

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen       80 default_server;
        server_name  localhost;

        listen 443 ssl;
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/wildcard.f5demos.com.crt.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/wildcard.f5demos.com.key.pem;

        #access_log  /var/log/nginx/host.access.log  main;

        location / {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }

        #error_page  404              /404.html;

        # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
        #
        error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        }

        # proxy the PHP scripts to Apache listening on 127.0.0.1:80
        #
        #location ~ \.php$ {
        #    proxy_pass   http://127.0.0.1;
        #}

        # pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000
        #
        #location ~ \.php$ {
        #    root           html;
        #    fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
        #    fastcgi_index  index.php;
        #    fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /scripts$fastcgi_script_name;
        #    include        fastcgi_params;
        #}

        # deny access to .htaccess files, if Apache's document root
        # concurs with nginx's one
        #
        #location ~ /\.ht {
        #    deny  all;
        #}

        # enable /api/ location with appropriate access control in order
        # to make use of NGINX Plus API
        #
        #location /api/ {
        #    api write=on;
        #    allow 127.0.0.1;
        #    deny all;
        #}

        # enable NGINX Plus Dashboard; requires /api/ location to be
        # enabled and appropriate access control for remote access
        #
        #location = /dashboard.html {
        #    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        #}
    
        location = /nginx_status {
            stub_status;
            access_log off;
        }    
    }
    ```

1. Click *Next* to display the diff viewer. This view will show you the changes made to the configuration.

    ![Diff viewer](media/lab3-9.png)

1. Click *Save and Publish*. You will see a status message indicating changes are being published, followed by a success message after several seconds.

1. Click the *Details* link on the page. You should now see the certificate, its validity status, as well as a new recommendation.

    ![Details link](media/lab3-10.png)

1. You can view the configuration, and recommendations by clicking the *View Configuration* link in the *Configuration Recommendations* section.

    ![Certificate status](media/lab3-11.png)

1. Select the *default.conf* file from the file picker. Note the blue dots and the number "1" next to default.conf; the configuration viewer highlights the location(s) of any recommendations it has for the NGINX configuration.

    ![Configuration Viewer](media/lab3-12.png)

## Config Sync Group

Config Sync Groups allow us to group multiple NGINX instances and leverage an identical configuration across all instances. This feature is extremely helpful in ephemeral environments, such as Docker and Kubernetes, as the NGINX instance can pull it's configuration versus needing to rebuild the NGINX container every time the configuration changes. This section will go through using this feature.

### Creating Config Sync Group

1. Go to the NGINX One Console.

1. From the left menu in the *Manage* section, click on *Config Sync Groups*.

1. Click on *Add Config Sync Group*.

    ![Add Config Sync Group](media/lab5-1.png)

1. On the right, enter your unique lab deployment name, *<GetVariable name="petname" />*, then select *Create* on the bottom. Your new Config Sync Group is now created.

    ![New Config Sync Group](media/lab5-2.png)

You can now explore your Config Sync Group by selecting *<GetVariable name="petname" />* from the list. 
After you select it, there are two tabs named *Details* and *Configuration*. 
The configuration defined in this group will be used as the single NGINX config to use for all NGINX instances in this group. 

Notice the configuration is empty when you first create a Config Sync Group. There are two ways to handle the initial configuration.

**Option 1:** When you add the first NGINX instance, the config from the NGINX instance will be used as the config for your Config Sync Group. We will be using this option for this lab.

**Option 2.** You can manually define it before you add any NGINX instances.

> **Note**: the 4 steps below are for reference only and are not required for the lab.

    1. Click the *Configuration* tab then click on *Edit Configuration*

        ![Manually Create Initial Configuration](media/lab5-3.png)

    1. An editor window appears that allows you to define the configuration to use for the NGINX instances.

        ![Manual Configuration](media/lab5-4.png)

    1. You can also add files by clicking on *Add File* but this is limited to the **/etc/nginx/** path.

    1. Select *Next* then *Save and Publish*

This lab will proceed with option 1 where the configuration will be auto-generated using the first NGINX instance added to this group.

### Adding NGINX to config sync group

We will now proceed with adding an NGINX instance to the Config Sync Group.

#### Adding existing instance

Lets start by adding an existing NGINX Plus instance.

1. Open up your config sync group.

1. Click on *Add Instance to Config Sync Group*.

    ![Add Existing Instance](media/lab5-5.png)

1. We will be using an existing NGINX instance so make sure *Add an existing instance to config sync group* is selected then click *Next*.

1. Follow the instructions on the console of your NGINX Plus instance named, **<GetVariable name="nginx-plus-1" />**.

1. After the **nginx-agent** is restarted, you now see your first NGINX instance added to this Config Sync Group.

    ![First NGINX Instance](media/lab5-6.png)

1. When you select the *Configuration* tab, notice the config here is the same as the config on the NGINX instance we just added.

#### Adding second NGINX Plus instance

Now that we added our first NGINX Plus instance, lets add our second NGINX Plus instance, <GetVariable name="nginx-plus-2" />, to the Config Sync Group.

TODO: Write this when N1 is back up and accessible

![Added Second NGINX Plus Instance](media/lab5-8.png)

### Updating and publishing configuration

Now that we have two instances in a Config Sync Group. Lets publish a new configuration to all instances that creates a new URL that returns an HTML response.

We will be making an update to the configuration defined in the config sync group then publish the change

1. In your *<GetVariable name="petname" />* Config Sync Group, go to the *Configuration* tab.

1. Click *Edit Configuration*

    ![Edit Configuration](media/lab5-9.png)

1. An editor should now appear. We will want to update **default.conf** so be sure to click on that file.

    ![Edit File](media/lab5-10.png)

1. Add the following section to the **server** block then click *Next*

    ```bash
    location /configsync {
        default_type text/html;
        return 200 '<html><body><h1>Published change made from NGINX One Config Sync Group</h1></body></html>';
    }
    ```

    The entire file should now look as follows:

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen       80 default_server;
        server_name  localhost;

        listen 443 ssl;
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/wildcard.f5demos.com.crt.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/wildcard.f5demos.com.key.pem;

        #access_log  /var/log/nginx/host.access.log  main;

        location / {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }

        #error_page  404              /404.html;

        # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
        #
        error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        }

        # proxy the PHP scripts to Apache listening on 127.0.0.1:80
        #
        #location ~ \.php$ {
        #    proxy_pass   http://127.0.0.1;
        #}

        # pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000
        #
        #location ~ \.php$ {
        #    root           html;
        #    fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;

1. The following screen will show a diff between existing and new config.

    ![Confirm Edits](media/lab5-11.png)

1. Confirm your changes and click *Save and Publish*.

We can now confirm the configuration changes on the NGINX instance by clicking the *Check* button for each NGINX instance below:

    <APIResponseCheck 
        componentName="nginx-plus-1" 
        path="/configsync" 
        searchString="Config Sync Group"
        targetStatusCode={200}  
    />
    <APIResponseCheck 
        componentName="nginx-plus-2" 
        path="/configsync" 
        searchString="Config Sync Group"
        targetStatusCode={200}  
    />

### Mixing NGINX Plus and NGINX Open Source Instances

You will be able to mix NGINX Plus and NGINX Open Source instances with the exception that the configuration must be compatible across NGINX OSS and NGINX PLus. 
For example, you will not be able to publish NGINX Plus unique configurations like [JWT authenticate](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-jwt-authentication/) to NGINX Open Source.

> **Note:** When you view details from an NGINX Open Source instance, there will be an error message that indicates thee status of the NGINX Open Source instance will be "Out of Sync". This will be resolved in an upcoming release.

We will now go through the steps of adding an NGINX OSS instance to your existing Config Sync Group:

1. Add your NGINX Open Source instance to your config sync group by repeating instructions from [Adding existing instance](#adding-existing-instance) that you did for NGINX Plus.

1. When you add the Open Source instance, the status shows "Out of Sync".

    ![Out of Sync Instance](media/lab5-15.png)

1. Click on your Open Source instance to view additional details about this. Notice the error message showing the reason why the configuration cannot be applied.

    ![Out of Sync Instance Details](media/lab5-16.png)

We will not go through the exercise of resolving the configuration such that it will be valid for both instance types. The point here is to show it is possible to mix instances and it is your responsibility to insure the configuration is valid for both NGINX Plus and NGINX Open Source.

### Removing OR Changing NGINX Instances from Config Sync Group

We will now go though the steps for removing an instance from config sync groups. In the example here, the main configuration from our config sync group is not compatible with NGINX Open Source and we are going to remove it.

To remove NGINX Open Source from this instance group:

1. Open console access to your NGINX Open Source instance.

1. Open **/var/lib/nginx-agent/agent-dynamic.conf** in a text editor and remove or comment out the following line.

    ```bash
    instance_group: labuser
    ```

    > :point_right: **Note:** You can also move an instance to another config sync group by changing the **instance_group** name.

1. Restart NGINX Agent.

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nginx-agent
    ```

There is not an interface on the UI that will allow you to either remove or change NGINX instance from the config sync group. If you do use the UI to remove an instance from the config sync group it will also remove the instance from being managed in NGINX One.

The screenshot below show the "Details" screen from the config sync group. It appears I can remove the instance from this instance group but keep the instance managed in NGINX One.

![Remove Instance](media/lab5-17.png)

But if you delete it on that screen, you will also notice the NGINX instance is no longer managed by NGINX One.

## NGINX OSS (Optional)

NGINX Agent isn’t limited to NGINX Plus; it can also be installed into NGINX Open Source instances. The UDF blueprint contains a second Ubuntu host with the package maintainer’s version of NGINX installed.

### Installing NGINX Agent on NGINX OSS

1. Connect to the "NGINX OSS" instance in UDF, either directly through SSH or through the jumphost. If connecting through the jumphost, the SSH command will be:

    ```bash
    ssh ubuntu@10.1.1.6
    ```

1. Because the hostname is used as the name of the instance in NGINX One, you should change the hostname to something that identifies it as yours. Ensure that you are working on the NGINX OSS instance (default hostname ip-10.1.1.6), and run the following command, substituting "yourname" with a string that identifies you as a user. Use only lowercase characters and hyphens. Note that the bash prompt will not update immediately; it will continue to show the previous hostname unless you log out and log back in. This does not affect the lab.

    ```bash
    sudo hostnamectl set-hostname yourname-nginx-oss
    ```

1. Observe the running NGINX instance on this machine.

    - If you are working from the jumphost, open the Chromium browser and navigate to **http://10.1.1.6/**

    - If you are connecting directly through UDF, locate the "NGINX OSS" component and select the "NGINX HTTP" access method.

    ![NGINX OSS Demo page](media/lab4-1.png)

1. From the NGINX OSS instance, run the following command to install the NGINX Agent. Substitute data-plane-key with the key you saved in the first lab. Make sure you are working on the NGINX OSS instance; if you accidentally install on the jumphost, the installation will succeed, but there will be no NGINX instance for the agent to connect to and the instance will appear as "Offline". If this occurs, return to the directions in lab 1 to create a new Data Plane Key.

    ```bash
    curl https://agent.connect.nginx.com/nginx-agent/install | DATA_PLANE_KEY='data-plane-key' sh -s -- -y
    ```

    The install script will install any necessary dependencies, and install the NGINX Agent with the appropriate settings for your system. You will see a warning about "stub_status" not being configured. You can ignore that warning.

1. Return to the NGINX One console. From the left menu in the "Manage" section, click "Instances". You should see your new instance in the list.

1. Click its hostname to view the instance details.

    ![Instance list](media/lab4-2.png)

1. Explore the instance details.

    ![Instance Details](media/lab4-3.png)

    Note that this instance has a different set of configuration recommendations than the vanilla NGINX Plus instance did. Package maintainers may ship NGINX with their own sets of defaults, which may or may not align with best practices. NGINX One provides a centralized view of such recommendations across the organization.

## NGINX Docker (Optional)

The **Lab Framework** from the UDF environment has **docker** installed and is setup so it can run an NGINX Plus container image. The container image we will use here is **private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/agent:debian** which has NGINX Plus with the Agent. If you want to see a list of all NGINX Plus with Agent tags, run the command below.

```bash
curl https://private-registry.nginx.com/v2/nginx-plus/agent/tags/list --key YOUR_NGINX_PLUS_KEY --cert YOUR_NGINX_PLUS_CERT
```

1. Go to the "Details" page of your Config Sync Group then click "Add Instance to Config Sync Group"

1. Select "Register a new instance with NGINX One then add to config sync group" then click "Next"

1. If you saved your "Data Plane Key" from a previous lab, select "Use existing Key". Otherwise select "Generate new key"

1. Provide your Data Plane Key if you selected "Use existing Key"

1. Select the "Docker Container" tab.

    ![Add New NGINX Plus Container](media/lab5-7.png)

1. Log in to the console of **Lab Framework** from UDF. This system already pulled the container image "Step 1" and "Step 2" can be skipped.

1. Run the command from Step 3 to start the NGINX Plus with Agent container. This command will also add this NGINX instance to your Config Sync Group.

1. Click "Done" to close out the window.

You will now see the second NGINX Plus instance added.

## Lab Cleanup

Time to clean up the resources you created in this lab. As a safety precaution, the NGINX One console will not allow you to delete an instance that is online. We will first have to shut down the instances before deleting them from the NGINX One console.

1. In the UDF deployment for this lab, click "Details" for the "NGINX OSS" component.

    ![Select the NGINX component details](media/cleanup-1.png)

1. Click the "Stop" button for this component.

    ![Select the NGINX component details](media/cleanup-2.png)

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left-hand menu in the "Manage" section, select "Instances".

1. Wait until the instance transitions to the "Unavailable" state before proceeding. You may need to click the "Refresh" button at the top right of the instance list.

    ![Instance Unavailable](media/cleanup-3.png)

1. Once Select the context menu for the NGINX OSS instance, and select
    "Delete".

    > :warning: **Warning:** Make sure you are deleting your own instance and not someone else’s.

    ![Deleting an instance](media/cleanup-4.png)

1. Confirm the deletion.

    ![Confirming the deletion](media/cleanup-5.png)

1. Repeat steps 1-6 for the NGINX Plus instance and the NGINX Plus container instance.

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left-hand menu in the "Manage" section, select "Data Plane Keys".

1. Select the context menu for the Data Plane Key you created in lab 1, and select "Revoke".

    > :warning: **Warning:** Make sure you are revoking your own key and not someone else’s.

    ![Revoking a Data Plane Key](media/cleanup-6.png)

1. Confirm the revocation.

    ![Confirming the revocation](media/cleanup-7.png)

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left-hand menu in the Manage section, select "Config Sync Groups".

1. Select the context menu for the Config Sync Group you created in lab 5, and select "Delete".

    ![Delete Config Sync Group](media/cleanup-8.png)

1. Click "Delete" to confirm.

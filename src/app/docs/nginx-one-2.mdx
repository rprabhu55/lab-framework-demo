title: NGINX One Console Lab - Part 2
description: An interactive lab highlighting the NGINX One Console
order: 2
---

## Console Overview

Now that we have set up our data plane key and deployed our NGINX instances we can take a look around the NGINX One Console:

1. Return to the NGINX One Console. From the left menu in the *Manage* section, click *Instances*.

1. You should see your **<GetVariable name="nginx-plus-1" />** instance in the list, click on it to view the instance details.

    ![NGINX One Instance List](media/lab2-7.png)

### Explore the instance details

The NGINX One Console provides several key metrics for us to evaluate:

    - Instance Certificates
    - Instance CVEs
    - Configuration Recommendations
    - Instance Details

    ![NGINX Plus instance details](media/lab2-8.png)

#### Instance Certificates

The NGINX One Console displays the number of certificates currently installed on the NGINX instance as well as the current status of the certificates, expiration date,
and the certificate's *Subject Name*.

We'll get to explore this in greater detail later in the lab when we install a SSL/TLS certificate.

#### Instance CVEs

The NGINX One Console displays the number of CVEs associated with the NGINX instance as well as their severity.  You can also find out more information about each CVE
with a link to the CVE Program website with extensive details about the CVE in question.

#### Configuration Recommendations

The NGINX One Console will evaluate the NGINX instance configuration and provide recommendations based on best practices and security concerns.
We'll get to explore this in greater detail later in the lab when we configure the stub_status location.

#### Instance Details

The NGINX One Console also provides various details about the NGINX instance such as:

    | Instance Type | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Availability | The availability status of the NGINX instance |
    | Data Plane Key | The data plane key associated with the NGINX instance |
    | Hostname | The hostname of the NGINX instance |
    | Last Seen | The last time the NGINX instance was seen |
    | NGINX Agent Version | The version of the NGINX Agent running on the instance |
    | NGINX Config Path | The path to the NGINX configuration file |
    | Operating System | The operating system running on the instance |
    | Registration Time | The time when the NGINX instance was registered |
    | Instance Type | The type of the NGINX instance |

### Explore NGINX One dashboard

The NGINX One Dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of metrics and findings about your global NGINX fleet.

You can navigate to the NGINX One Dashboard view by selecting *Dashboard* under the *Overview* section on the left.

![Dashboard Side Menu](media/lab1-5.png)

You now see a Dashboard view like the example shown below.

![Dashboard View](media/lab1-6.png)

This view provides the following metrics for all NGINX instances.

    | Metric Type | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Availability | The overall reachability and availability of your NGINX fleet is displayed here. |
    | NGINX Versions | We can see at a glance what proportion of our fleet is running Plus vs. OSS, and how many instances are running outdated or non-standard versions. |
    | OS Distribution | Similarly, we can see which OSes are part of the fleet. |
    | Certificates | This chart provides insight on expiring certificates that need attention, as well as expired ones that should be removed. |
    | Configuration Recommendations | NGINX One analyzes the configuration files on all of the instances it manages. When a configuration presents a potential security risk or is otherwise not in accordance with best practices, a recommendation is shown. |
    | CVEs | Any CVEs that apply to an instance in your fleet are shown here. |
    | CPU Utilization | The instances with the highest CPU Utilization are shown here for quick visibility into potential performance issues. |
    | Memory Utilization | Top memory consumers are also shown here. |
    | Disk Space Utilization | Along with CPU and memory, instances with the highest disk utilization are shown here to surface possible disk space issues. |
    | Unsuccessful Responses | Instances with the most 4xx or 5xx errors appear here to identify potential attacks, misconfigurations, or upstream application issues. |
    | Network Usage | Top network consumers can help identify targets for optimization. Unusual traffic patterns could potentially indicate an attack attempt. |

**Drilling Down**

Clicking a detail line in any of these charts will let you drill-down and see the instances affected by that particular finding.

## Configuration via the Console

In this section, we will leverage NGINX One Console to enable the [stub_status](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html?_ga=2.62776364.1844058681.1724599557-1323320886.1720986347)
location in our **<GetVariable name="nginx-plus-1" />** NGINX instance's configuration.

The stub_status allows users to collect basic metrics about the NGINX instance such as:

- Active connections
- Total number of accepted client connections
- Total number of client requests
- and many more

### Adding a stub_status directive

1. In the NGINX One console, select *Manage* and then *Instances* from the left menu.

1. You should see your **<GetVariable name="nginx-plus-1" />** instance in the list. Click it to view the instance details.

1. Click the *Configuration* link near the top of the instance screen. You will be presented with the configuration editor.

    ![Configuration link](media/lab3-1.png)


#### NGINX Configuration

Now let's take a look at what the **/etc/nginx/nginx.conf** configuration is doing:

    ```nginx
    user  nginx;
    worker_processes  auto;

    error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log notice;
    pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;

    events {
        worker_connections  1024;
    }
    ```

Let's break down this portion of the NGINX configuration:

**1. *user  nginx;***

This line specifies the user under which NGINX will run as a process. In this case, it's running as the *nginx* user. This is important for security and permission reasons.

When NGINX starts, it needs to bind to certain system resources (e.g., network sockets). By specifying a specific user, we ensure that any processes started by NGINX will run with minimal privileges, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or resource consumption.

**2. worker_processes  auto;**

This line configures how many worker processes NGINX will create to handle incoming requests. The value is set to *auto*, which means that NGINX will automatically determine the optimal number of workers based on the system's capabilities and load.

The *auto* value tells NGINX to:

    * On systems with multiple CPU cores, create a worker process for each core.
    * On systems with a single CPU core, use the system's default maximum process limit (usually 1024).
    * Consider other factors like memory availability and load when deciding on the optimal number of workers.

**3. error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log notice;**

This line configures how NGINX logs errors that occur during execution. The *notice* level is set, which means that:

    * Errors with a severity level greater than or equal to NOTICE will be logged.
    * Other error levels (e.g., ERROR, WARNING) won't be logged.

The log file location */var/log/nginx/error.log* indicates where NGINX will write its error messages. This is the standard log location for most Linux distributions.

**4. pid /var/run/nginx.pid;**

This line specifies the file path where NGINX will store its process ID (PID). The PID is a unique identifier that allows you to manage and monitor running processes on your system.

In this case, the PID is written to */var/run/nginx.pid*, which is a common location for Linux services like NGINX.

**5. worker_connections 1024;**

This line specifies the maximum number of simultaneous connections a worker process can handle. In this case, it's set to 1024, which means each worker process will be able to accept up to 1024 simultaneous client connections.

    ```nginx
    http {
        include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
        default_type  application/octet-stream;

        log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                        '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                        '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

        access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;

        sendfile        on;
        #tcp_nopush     on;

        keepalive_timeout  65;

        #gzip  on;

        include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
    }
    ```

Here's a brief explanation of this portion of the NGINX configuration:

**HTTP Block**

This block configures how NGINX handles HTTP requests.

**1. include /etc/nginx/mime.types;**

Includes the MIME types file, which maps file extensions to their corresponding content types.

**2. default_type application/octet-stream;**

Specifies the default response type for unknown content types.

**3. log_format main ...**

Defines a custom log format called "main", which logs various request details (e.g., client IP, user agent).

**4. access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;**

Enables access logging to the specified file using the defined log format.

**5. sendfile on;**

Enables the sendfile() method for sending files directly from disk to clients, improving performance.

**6. keepalive_timeout 65;**

Sets the keep-alive timeout to 65 seconds, allowing NGINX to maintain connections with clients for a longer period.

**7. include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;**

Includes all configuration files in the specified directory (e.g., virtual hosts).

Now lets take a look at what the **/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf** configuration is doing:

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen       80 default_server;
        server_name  localhost;

        #access_log  /var/log/nginx/host.access.log  main;

        location / {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }

        #error_page  404              /404.html;

        # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
        #
        error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        }
    }
    ```

Here's a brief overview of this NGINX configuration:

**Server Block**

This block configures a single server that listens on port 80 and responds to requests for the domain *localhost*.

- *listen 80 default_server;* specifies that this server should listen on port 80 by default.
- *server_name localhost;* indicates that this server will respond to requests from the domain *localhost*.

**Root Directory and Indexing**

The configuration sets up a single location block that serves files from the */usr/share/nginx/html* directory:

- *root /usr/share/nginx/html;* specifies the root directory for this location.
- *index index.html index.htm;* specifies the default index file to serve when no specific file is requested (in this case, either *index.html* or *index.htm*).

**Error Handling**

The configuration also sets up error handling:

- *error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;* specifies that if any of these specific HTTP errors occur, the client should be redirected to the static page */50x.html*.
- *location = /50x.html* specifies where NGINX can find the error page file.

#### Edit the NGINX Configuration

1. Click the *Edit Configuration* button above the editor.

    ![Edit Configuration link](media/lab3-2.png)

1. Select the **/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf** file from the tree view on the left side of the configuration editor.

    ![Select default.conf file](media/lab3-3.png)

1. Edit the selected file to include a location block at the end of the server block with
    the **stub_status** directive. Add the following location block to the server block:

        ```nginx
            location = /nginx_status {
                stub_status;
            }
        ```

    The file should like this (commented out configurations have been removed):

        ```nginx
        server {
            listen       80 default_server;
            server_name  localhost;

            #access_log  /var/log/nginx/host.access.log  main;

            location / {
                root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
                index  index.html index.htm;
            }

            #error_page  404              /404.html;

            # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
            #
            error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
            location = /50x.html {
                root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            }

            location = /nginx_status {
                stub_status;
                access_log off;
            }
        }
        ```

1. You will see that there is a message below the editor:

    > *1 recommendation found for /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf <br />
        Security - Error: stub_status should have access control list defined*.

    - **Why?** NGINX One includes a configuration advisor and it identified that exposing the **stub_status** endpoint open to the world is considered a security risk.
    - We can remediate this by adding an ACL to the **/nginx_status** location block to only allow our lab environments's local networks and NGINX Agent (running locally on the instance) to access the stub status endpoint.

    ![config warning](media/lab3-4.png)

1. Update that section of the configuration to the following:

        ```nginx
            location /nginx_status {
                stub_status;
                allow 10.0.0.0/8;
                allow 172.18.0.0/16;
                allow 127.0.0.1;
                deny all;
            }
        ```

    Note that the warning should disappear.

1. Click *Next* to display the diff viewer. This view will show you the changes made to the configuration.

    ![Diff viewer](media/lab3-5.png)

1. Click *Save and Publish*. You will see a status message indicating changes are being published, followed by a success message after several seconds.

    ![Publish config pending](media/lab3-6.png)

    ![Publish config success](media/lab3-7.png)

1. Check that the *stub_status* module is working by clicking the *Check* button below.

    <APICheck
        componentName="nginx-plus-1"
        path="/nginx_status"
        targetStatusCode={200}
    />

### Using a TLS certificate

In this section, we will configure our **<GetVariable name="nginx-plus-1" />** NGINX instance to leverage an SSL/TLS certificate.

1. In the NGINX One Console, edit the **/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf** file again on the **<GetVariable name="nginx-plus-1" />** instance. Add the following to the server block:

        ```nginx
            listen 443 ssl;
            ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/wildcard.f5demos.com.crt.pem;
            ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/wildcard.f5demos.com.key.pem;
        ```

1. Click *Next* to display the diff viewer. This view will show you the changes made to the configuration.

    ![Diff viewer](media/lab3-9.png)

1. Click *Save and Publish*. You will see a status message indicating changes are being published, followed by a success message after several seconds.

1. Click the *Details* link on the page. You should now see the certificate, its validity status, expiration date, and subject name.

    ![Details link](media/lab3-10.png)

1. The *details* page will also show a new recommendation. You can view the configuration, and recommendations by clicking the *View Configuration* link in the *Configuration Recommendations* section.

    ![Certificate status](media/lab3-11.png)

1. Select the *default.conf* file from the file picker. Note the blue dots and the number "1" next to default.conf; the configuration viewer highlights the location(s) of any recommendations it has for the NGINX configuration.

    ![Configuration Viewer](media/lab3-12.png)

1. Notice the editor has a "Best Practice" notice indicating that *default_server* should set. Update the configuration to acknowledge this recommendation. <br />&nbsp;<br />The entire **/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf** file should now look as follows (commented out configurations have been removed):

        ```nginx
        server {
            listen       80 default_server;
            server_name  localhost;

            listen 443 ssl default_server;
            ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/wildcard.f5demos.com.crt.pem;
            ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/wildcard.f5demos.com.key.pem;

            #access_log  /var/log/nginx/host.access.log  main;

            location / {
                root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
                index  index.html index.htm;
            }

            #error_page  404              /404.html;

            # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
            #
            error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
            location = /50x.html {
                root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            }

            location /nginx_status {
                stub_status;
                allow 10.0.0.0/8;
                allow 172.18.0.0/16;
                allow 127.0.0.1;
                deny all;
            }
        }
        ```

1. Check your work:<br />&nbsp;<br />To check that the <GetVariable name="nginx-plus-1" /> instance is now listening on 443 click the *Check* button below.

    <APICheck
        componentName="nginx-plus-1"
        targetStatusCode={200}
        tlsComponent={true}
    />

## Config Sync Groups

Config Sync Groups allow us to group multiple NGINX instances and leverage an identical configuration across all instances. This feature is extremely helpful in ephemeral environments, such as Docker and Kubernetes, as the NGINX instance can pull its configuration versus needing to rebuild the NGINX container every time the configuration changes. This section will go through using this feature.

### Creating a Config Sync Group

1. Go to the NGINX One Console.

1. From the left menu in the *Manage* section, click on *Config Sync Groups*.

1. Click on *Add Config Sync Group*.

    ![Add Config Sync Group](media/lab5-1.png)

1. On the right, enter your unique lab deployment name, **<GetVariable name="petname" />**, then select *Create* on the bottom.

    ![Create New Config Sync Group](media/lab5-2.png)

1. Your unique Config Sync Group **<GetVariable name="petname" />** should be in the list.

    ![New Config Sync Group](media/lab5-3.png)

You can now explore your Config Sync Group by selecting **<GetVariable name="petname" />**.
When you select it, there are two tabs named *Details* and *Configuration*.

On the *Details* tab, there are two views: *Details* represents additional details of this group and *Instances* represents the NGINX instances that are in this group.

![Details View](media/lab5-4.png)

On the *Configuration* tab, there is a view that defines the NGINX configurations to use for all NGINX instances in this Config Sync Group.

![Configuration View](media/lab5-5.png)

Notice the configuration is empty when you first create a Config Sync Group. There are two ways to handle the initial configuration.

**Option 1:** Auto-generate the Config Sync Group's configuration by adding the first NGINX instance. The existing config from the NGINX instance will be used as the config for your Config Sync Group.

**Option 2:** Manually define the NGINX configurations before adding any NGINX instances using the UI text editor.

### (Option 1) Adding NGINX instance to config sync group

We will now proceed with adding the first NGINX instance to the Config Sync Group. We will be using the existing configuration from this first NGINX instance as the Config Sync Group's configuration.

#### Adding a New Instance

Let's start by adding an new NGINX Plus instance.

You can do it by taking the following actions from the NGINX One console: select *Add Instance to Config Sync Group* ->
select *Register a new instance with NGINX One then add to config sync group* ->
select *Next* ->
select *Use existing Key* -> provide *Data Plane Key*
select *Docker Container* tab.

The instructions on the screen tell you how to:
    - Login to the NGINX private registry
    - Pull an NGINX Plus instance from the NGINX private registry
    - Run the container with the required NGINX One Console connection details

But for this lab, we have automated this process for you:

1. Click the *Run* button below to start a new NGINX Plus instance. As a convenience, the dataplane key and Config Sync Group have already been provided to the containers.

    <Docker
        name="nginx-plus-2"
        desc="NGINX Plus R32 with Agent."
        image="private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/agent:debian"
        env={[
            {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_GRPCPORT", value: "443"},
            {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_HOST", value: "agent.connect.nginx.com"},
            {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_ENABLE", value: "true"},
            {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY", value: "false"},
            {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN", isVariable: true, isSecret: true},
            {name: "NGINX_AGENT_INSTANCE_GROUP", value: `${process.env["PETNAME"]}`}
        ]}
        attrs={[
            { name: "volume", value: `${process.env["CONTAINER_MOUNT_BASE_DIR"]}/ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl` }
        ]}
    />

1. Once the NGINX instance is up and running, press the *Test* button, to confirm the instance is online and responding to HTTP requests.

1. Now, in the NGINX One Console, look at your Config Sync Group and you should see a new instance registered.

    ![First NGINX Instance](media/lab5-6.png)

1. When you select the *Configuration* tab, notice the configuration here is identical to your first NGINX instance you just added.

1. Based on what you have already learned, update the Config Sync Group configuration file **/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf** with the example below:

        ```nginx
        server {
            listen       80 default_server;
            server_name  localhost;

            #access_log  /var/log/nginx/host.access.log  main;

            location / {
                root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
                index  index.html index.htm;
            }

            #error_page  404              /404.html;

            # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
            #
            error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
            location = /50x.html {
                root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            }

            location /test_header {
                add_header X-Test-App true;
                return 200 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n<html><body>Howdy!</body></html>';
            }
        }
        ```

1. Now we will test your configuration by clicking the *Check* button below:

    <APIHeaderCheck
        componentName="nginx-plus-2"
        headerName="X-Test-App"
        headerValue="true"
        path="/test_header"
        targetStatusCode={200}
    />

Great! You have successfully created a Config Sync Group and synchronized your first configuration.  Next, we will add a new instance to the Config Sync Group.

#### Adding a second NGINX Plus instance

Now that we have added our first NGINX Plus instance to the Config Sync Group, let's add our second NGINX Plus instance, **<GetVariable name="nginx-plus-3" />**, to the Config Sync Group.

1. Click the *Run* button below to start a new NGINX Plus instance.

    <Docker
        name="nginx-plus-3"
        desc="NGINX Plus R32 with Agent."
        image="private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/agent:debian"
        env={[
            {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_GRPCPORT", value: "443"},
            {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_HOST", value: "agent.connect.nginx.com"},
            {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_ENABLE", value: "true"},
            {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY", value: "false"},
            {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN", isVariable: true, isSecret: true},
            {name: "NGINX_AGENT_INSTANCE_GROUP", value: `${process.env["PETNAME"]}`}
        ]}
        attrs={[
            { name: "volume", value: `${process.env["CONTAINER_MOUNT_BASE_DIR"]}/ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl` }
        ]}
    />

1. Verify the new NGINX instance is part of your *<GetVariable name="petname" />* Config Sync Group and wait for the Config Sync Status to transition from *Sync in Progress* to *In Sync*.

    ![Added Second NGINX Plus Instance](media/lab5-7.png)

1. Test that the configuration was synchronized to all instances:
    <APICheckContainer>
        <APIHeaderCheck
            componentName="nginx-plus-2"
            headerName="X-Test-App"
            headerValue="true"
            path="/test_header"
            targetStatusCode={200}
        />
        <APIHeaderCheck
            componentName="nginx-plus-3"
            headerName="X-Test-App"
            headerValue="true"
            path="/test_header"
            targetStatusCode={200}
        />
    </APICheckContainer>

### Updating and publishing configuration

Now that we have two instances in the **<GetVariable name="petname" />** Config Sync Group, let's publish a new configuration to them.

1. Based on what you have already learned, add the following section to the **server** block of the **/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf** file:

        ```bash
            location /test_publish {
                default_type text/html;
                return 200 '<html><body><h1>Published change made from NGINX One Config Sync Group</h1></body></html>';
            }
        ```

    The entire file should now look as follows:

        ```nginx
        server {
            listen       80 default_server;
            server_name  localhost;

            #access_log  /var/log/nginx/host.access.log  main;

            location / {
                root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
                index  index.html index.htm;
            }

            #error_page  404              /404.html;

            # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
            #
            error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
            location = /50x.html {
                root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            }

            location /test_header {
                add_header X-Test-App true;
                return 200 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n<html><body>Howdy!</body></html>';
            }

            location /test_publish {
                default_type text/html;
                return 200 '<html><body><h1>Published change made from NGINX One Config Sync Group</h1></body></html>';
            }
        }
        ```

1. Click *Next*, then *Save and Publish*.

1. We can now confirm the configuration changes on the NGINX instances by clicking the *Check* button for each NGINX instance below:

    <APICheckContainer>
        <APIResponseCheck
            componentName="nginx-plus-2"
            path="/test_publish"
            searchString="Config Sync Group"
            targetStatusCode={200}
        />
        <APIResponseCheck
            componentName="nginx-plus-3"
            path="/test_publish"
            searchString="Config Sync Group"
            targetStatusCode={200}
        />
    </APICheckContainer>

### Removing NGINX Instances from a Config Sync Group

As part of your day-to-day tasks, you may need to remove NGINX instances from a Config Sync Group.  This section will walk you through this process:

To remove an NGINX Plus instance from this instance group:

1. Navigate to the *Details* view of your **<GetVariable name="petname" />** Config Sync Group.

1. Click the *Actions* link for the **<GetVariable name="nginx-plus-3" />** instance and choose *Delete*.

    ![Remove Instance](media/lab5-8.png)

1. Confirm by clicking *Delete*.

> **Note:** Removing an NGINX instance from a Config Sync Group will also remove the instances from the NGINX One Console, but will not remove the last active configuration.

### (Option 2) Create a Config Sync Group for NGINX OSS

As you have seen so far, you can manage both NGINX Plus and OSS instances in the NGINX One console.
In this portion of the lab, we will focus on NGINX OSS. We will see the benefit of from having consistent configuration
across multiple NGINX OSS instances. When NGINX OSS instances are created that are pre-configured to use a Config Sync Group,
they will automatically download their configuration on startup. This will save time, and ensure consistency between instances.

The previous lab contained an existing NGINX configuration when the first NGINX instance was added.
Now, let's create a custom NGINX configuration before any NGINX instances are added to a Config Sync Group. We will re-create
the Config Sync Group.

1. Select *Config Sync Groups* under *Manage* on the left to bring up a list of all Config Sync Groups.

    ![List Config Sync Group](media/lab5-9.png)

1. Based on the work in the previous lab, in the NGINX One Console, create a new Config Sync Group named **<GetVariable name="petname" />-oss**.

1. You will create a custom NGINX configuration before any NGINX instances are added to a Config Sync Group. Click the *Configuration* tab then click on *Edit Configuration*.

    ![Manually Create Initial Configuration](media/lab5-10.png)

1. A text editor window appears that allows you to define the configuration to use for the NGINX instances in this group.

    ![Manual Configuration](media/lab5-11.png)

1. Insert the following NGINX configuration into the **/etc/nginx/nginx.conf** file:

    ```nginx
    user  nginx;
    worker_processes  auto;

    error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log notice;
    pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;

    events {
        worker_connections  1024;
    }

    http {
        types {
            text/html  html htm shtml;
            text/css   css;
            text/xml   xml;
        }

        default_type  application/octet-stream;
        log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                        '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                        '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
        access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;
        sendfile        on;
        keepalive_timeout  65;
        include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
    }
    ```

1. Create a file named **/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf**:

    ![Name File](media/lab5-12.png)

1. Be sure the new file is selected in the text editor:

    ![Select File](media/lab5-13.png)

1. Use the following NGINX configuration for **/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf**.

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  localhost;

        location / {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }

        location /test_custom {
            add_header X-Test-Custom-App true;
            return 200 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n<html><body>Howdy!</body></html>';
        }

        error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        }
    }
    ```

1. After you complete the above, it should look like the following screenshot:

    ![Final Config View](media/lab5-14.png)

1. Select *Next*, then *Save and Publish*.

    ![Final Diff](media/lab5-15.png)

1. Now let's add two new NGINX Open Source instances pre-configured to join this Config Sync Group. Select *Run* for each NGINX OSS instance below. As a convenience, the dataplane key and Config Sync Group have already been provided to the containers.

    <DockerContainer>
        <Docker
            name="nginx-oss-1"
            desc="NGINX OSS 1.27.1 with Agent."
            image="private-registry-test.nginx.com/nginx/agent:1.27.1-alpine"
            env={[
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_GRPCPORT", value: "443"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_HOST", value: "agent.connect.nginx.com"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_ENABLE", value: "true"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY", value: "false"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN", isVariable: true, isSecret: true},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_INSTANCE_GROUP", value: `${process.env["PETNAME"]}-oss`}
            ]}
            attrs={[
                { name: "volume", value: `${process.env["CONTAINER_MOUNT_BASE_DIR"]}/ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl` }
            ]}
        />
        <Docker
            name="nginx-oss-2"
            desc="NGINX OSS 1.27.1 with Agent."
            image="private-registry-test.nginx.com/nginx/agent:1.27.1-alpine"
            env={[
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_GRPCPORT", value: "443"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_HOST", value: "agent.connect.nginx.com"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_ENABLE", value: "true"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY", value: "false"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN", isVariable: true, isSecret: true},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_INSTANCE_GROUP", value: `${process.env["PETNAME"]}-oss`}
            ]}
            attrs={[
                { name: "volume", value: `${process.env["CONTAINER_MOUNT_BASE_DIR"]}/ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl` }
            ]}
        />
    </DockerContainer>

1. Now you can use the check below to confirm the **/test_custom** URL is functional.

    <APICheckContainer>
        <APIHeaderCheck
            componentName="nginx-oss-1"
            headerName="X-Test-Custom-App"
            headerValue="true"
            path="/test_custom"
            targetStatusCode={200}
        />
        <APIHeaderCheck
            componentName="nginx-oss-2"
            headerName="X-Test-Custom-App"
            headerValue="true"
            path="/test_custom"
            targetStatusCode={200}
        />
    </APICheckContainer>

1. Return to the *Details* tab on the console to verify that the two new NGINX OSS instances have been added to the **<GetVariable name="petname" />-oss** Config Sync Group:

    ![NGINX OSS instances appear in the oss config sync group](media/lab5-16.png)

Great! Now you have now pushed a customized NGINX configuration to all NGINX instances that joined a Config Sync Group.

### Review

Great job! Through the use of Config Sync Groups, you have now accomplished a common Day-2 operation of scaling or upgrading your NGINX instances and NGINX One Console made this process extremely easy and fast!  You can also do this via the [NGINX One Console API](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-one/api/api-reference-guide/) if you prefer to handle these steps through a pipeline.

> :point_right: It is possible to mix NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS instances in a Config Sync Group. However, the NGINX configuration must be compatible for both the NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS instances. For example, you will not be able to publish configurations that are exclusive to NGINX Plus, like [JWT authentication](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-jwt-authentication/) to NGINX OSS. However, the ability to mix NGINX editions in a Config Sync Group can be very valuable in certain situations, such as when migrating from NGINX OSS to NGINX Plus.

## Lab Cleanup

Time to clean up the resources you created in this lab. As a safety precaution, the NGINX One console will not allow you to delete an instance that is online. We will first have to shut down the instances before deleting them from the NGINX One console.

1. Click **Stop** on all the Docker instances displayed below:

    <DockerContainer>
        <Docker
